# Movies
An application to manage a database to keep track of movies you own and 
details about them, such as the title, genre, rating, year it was released, 
director, actors and description.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is simply to practice writing Java as a side project 
and since I personally have a seemingly unmanageable movie collection, I thought an application
that could keep track of what movies you own would solve a problem.

## Tech
** Built with **
    - Java
    
## Features
- keep track of movies you own
- search database by any of the properties included (title, genre, rating, release year, director, actors)
- add movies to the database when you acquire new ones
- remove movies from the database if you no longer own them
- maybe add a wishlist of movies you want to own **future implementation**
